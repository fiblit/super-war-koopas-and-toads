# About

This is my game for the [50th Weekly Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/weekly-game-jam-50)
themed "Remake a Classic". My idea was to copycat Warcraft 1, theme it in the
Mario universe, and then progressively add more Mario-esque mechancis like
destroyable blocks, assymetric strengths, a grand world view, and more.

# Play / Build

This game uses the [Love2D](https://love2d.org/) lua game framework. It's my
first time using Love (and lua!), so I thought a game jam would be a good way
to try both.

For now, my best advice for "building" and playing the game is to just follow
the instructions on the [wiki](https://love2d.org/wiki/Game_Distribution) for
Love. I will eventually add tagged release builds for Windows and Ubuntu. (I
don't have a Mac to test with.)
